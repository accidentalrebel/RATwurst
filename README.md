# RATwurst

The aim of this project is for me to learn about the techniques used by malware by making a Remote Access Tool.

The more I understand the inner workings of malware and the reasoning behind how they were built, the better I can protect against them.

Only used for educational purposes. See disclaimer below.

## Noteworthy features (so far)

* Runtime loading of DLLs
* Anti-virus evasion via simple strings obfuscation

## TODOs

* [ ] Client-server communication via sockets
* [ ] Fetch client host information
* [ ] Run command on client
* [ ] Server to client file transfer
* [ ] Client to server file transfer
* [ ] Persistence
* [ ] Anti-debugging
* [ ] Anti-emulation/Anti-sandbox
* [ ] and more... (?)
